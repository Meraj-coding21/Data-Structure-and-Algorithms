## Overview

This repository is intended for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and follows best practices for readability and efficiency. You can find both iterative and recursive solutions where applicable.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

* [merge_sort.py](merge_sort.py)

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around the pivot.

* [quick_sort.py](quick_sort.py)

### Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

#### Iterative Approach

The iterative approach to Binary Search avoids recursion by using a loop to repeatedly narrow down the search interval.

* [binary_search_iterative.py](binary_search_iterative.py)

#### Recursive Approach

The recursive approach to Binary Search involves calling the function recursively to narrow down the search interval.

* [binary_search_recursive.py](binary_search_recursive.py)
